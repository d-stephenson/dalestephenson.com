									<h1>Personal<br />

									</header>
								<!-- <div class="image main"><img src="images/pic01.jpg" alt="" /></div> -->
								<center><h2>Proven leadership skills<br>
									with an ability to resolve conflicts</h2></center>
								<p>Building a team and taking responsibility for setting and monitoring the quality control practices of audits to ensure they met the legal and professional requirements.</br> 
									Bringing teams together under a company merger situation, encourage them to communicate their ideas and recommendations.</br>  
									Supporting a member of the team to understand the importance of providing information in a timely manner, and to appreciate this was something that was expected of the whole department. Non-verbal communication was essential to clearly relay messages in a way that would have a positive impact.</p>
								<center><h2>Effectively manage own time and plan <br>
									strategically to support the business</h2></center>
								<p>Develop IT systems in local government and managed client businesses to improve communication and information flow within departments. Process automation required a change in working structure and environment meaning that consideration for how this affected the team was essential. </br> 
									Creating strategic business reviews to support mainstream bank funding up to £5M for asset acquisition. Including clearly presenting timelines for the completion of agreed milestones. </br>  
									Implement scheduled correspondence with relevant internal and external parties detailing progress with agreed departmental goals and required KPIs.</p>
								<center><h2>Excellent communicator and listener<br>
									especially when working within a team</h2></center>
								<p>Actively listen to customers with different circumstances and requirements, a necessary skill in the hospitality industry and public sector local government.</br> 
									Investigating historical enforcement issues with the team. Using the information and remaining calm, appreciate the view of the customer and keeping the conversation on topic to bring about resolution.</br> 
									Changing the perception of clients to understand the remit was to work for and with them to support their business turnaround and not operate on instruction of the bank or financial institution.</br>   
									Presenting financial information to board level Directors without resorting to technical language</p>
								<center><h2>An analytical eye with a background<br>
									in researching commercial entities to return to growth</h2></center>
								<p>Produce business reports to effect turnaround, assessing the previous 3 years financial and operational data including KPI’s, identify cost savings and staffing requirements, research competitors and market trends, and provide recommendations to return to profitability.</br> 
									Use both formal documentation and group discussions to help teams and financial institutions understand the need to implement organisational policies and procedures and adopt and train employees with new technology solutions to improve processes that benefit the business system.</p>
								<center><h2>Adaptable and resilient<br>
									when working under pressure</h2></center>
								<p>Managing up to 45 business clients ranging from large scale multiple occupancy hotels to smaller independent operators, building relationships with clients and agents under difficult circumstances.</br> 
									Forming a team to bring into effect departmental digital change in anticipation of the large-scale restructure in how the Council is to deliver its services into the future. As a member of the change committee, work through cultural change to communicate the benefits via departmental presentations and meetings that allowed the team to voice concerns in a safe environment and allow for observing how they adapted and responded to help inform the speed of change.</br>  
									Acting in a socially responsible manner when managing businesses experiencing a change in ownership, particularly when negotiating with staff under stressful transfer of ownership regulations, ensuring they understood that jobs were safe during the process and would continue to be safe despite the expected organisational change and adoption of new technologies.</p>
